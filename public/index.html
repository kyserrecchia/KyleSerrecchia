					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p>Hi there, I'm Kyle! I'm a philosopher and math/science enthusiast turned web developer.  And software is my passion! I love utilizing sound principles to break down complex problems and build up clean, effective solutions.</p>
					<p>I also have a constant craving to learn more because, like Socrates, the more I learn, the less I feel I know!  Having completed a bachelor's in philosophy a little over a year ago and a full-stack web development bootcamp through UCLA a few months ago, I've begun working toward an M.S. in Software Engineering at CSUN while seeking employment as a web developer.</p>
					<p>If you would like to message me to inquire about, well, anything at all, I invite you to reach out to me any time! <a onclick="scrollFunc.contact()">CONTACT ME</a></p>

						A cute little web app made for a dear friend using React and CSS Grid to show off some of her photography.

				<div class='p2desc'>
					<p class="pdesc">
						A web App for readers of technical documents that are bombarded with initialisms and acronyms and need some help remembering them! They enter some text, choose their subject, and submit; then it is rendered below with the meanings of those tricky abbreviations available upon hover.  And all done with vanilla js!  
					</p>

				<div class='p3desc'>
					<p class="pdesc">
						A colorful game for learning and practicing function transformations. Functions are randomly generated for the user and their graphs displayed with HTML's Canvas - they are then challenged to pick which of those graphs corresponds to the function defined above.  Try it out!
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class='p4desc'>
					<p class="pdesc">
						Of course, this is this very site!  There's a little formatting with CSS Grid, but it's mostly just vanilla everything.  My goal was something simple and elegant, but still very colorful and alive.  I think my personality really shines through!
